                <p>The Australian bushfires, which lasted from October 2019 to January 2020, are unprecedented in terms of devastation to the daily lives of individuals and the environment.  </p>
                <p>The heavily impacted bushfires are concentrated on Australia's coast, according to map visualizations captured by satellites.  </p>
                <p>According to the longitude, the number of fires has increased significantly in the coastal areas from Sydney to Melbourne with higher longitudes. </p>
                <p>The government can increase the focus on jungle safety during high temperature periods, try to cool down and minimize the accidental entry of passers-by.</p>

              <p>Through the overall cognition of the geographical location, the perspective is dispersed from the whole to the state.</p>
                <p> NSW and VIC are the states that have been severely affected from the longitude study. According to the comparison of Forest area in fire and Total Fire Area data, more than 90% of the hectares burned by the three-month fire are forest areas.</p>                   
                <p>Compared with the total hectares of the forest area to which each state belongs, it can be seen that the degree of damage to the natural environment is huge. It is undoubtedly a reminder that states with high temperatures and many forest areas need to strengthen protection interventions for the jungle environment.</p>

                <p>Since different forest tenures have completely different ecological environments, different measures should be taken for forest types in both conservation and intervention.</p>
                <p>Through the statistics of each State's jungle burning category, it can be seen that the Nature conservation reserve is the most flammable area. Almost every area has hundreds of thousands of hectares of jungle burned. Multiple-use, Private, and other Crown land are in different states. Burning is very different.</p>
                <p>It helps to propose different protection measures for different forest tenures, and also provides several types of local attention for each State.</p>
